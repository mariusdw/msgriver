I needed a way to quickly put all work emails and notes into elasticsearch, so that it would be easy to search through everything in one go at a later stage. 

This program can be ran in the background. It will then pull messages automatically from the email server, indexing them into elasticsearch. It is also possible to manually add notes that will then also be indexed.
